AppEngine Cart is an open source JAVA/[Slim3](https://sites.google.com/site/slim3appengine/) based shopping cart system that runs in [Google App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/).  It is a stand alone application that will allow Internet Merchants to get started selling their products within minutes, without the need or worry of expensive server setup or costs.

There is no release available, however development has started and hopefully a first revision will be available early next year.
